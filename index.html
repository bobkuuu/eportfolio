<p>A PCM5102 modulized External I2S DAC Card was also designed along with the project.</p>
<p>It turns out to have a smoothier, softer sound than TDA1543. The TDA1543 still excels in reproducing punchy bass and lower human voice.</p>

<p>(2013 - 2014) DIY 12AU7-IRF510 Headphone Amplifier</p>
<p><a href="http://diyaudioprojects.com/Solid/12AU7-IRF510-LM317-Headamp/">Reference Design</a></p>

<p>This is perhaps my largest scale DIY project in a while. The project lasted for 1 year and technically the improvement on it is not ended.</p>
<p>From PCB preparation to the drawings and design of the aluminum chassis, I have learnt much from the Cadsoft Eagle PCB and solidworks.</p>
<p>While the very first prototype was assembled successfully, a hint of thermal noise reminded me to pay extra attention to the heat sinking and routing design.</p>
<p>Eventually, another version with almost no noise(the one in the photos) were installed and the tube lit up the Christmas at that year.</p>

<p>(2012 - 2013) DIY CHA47 Headphone Amplifier + Ohmanâ€™s Crossfeed Filter</p>
<p>Arguably the first complete amp project that is more than just purchase PCB and do the soldering)</p>
<p>The painting on aluminum chassis was quite time-consuming. Several thin layers of metal primer were needed to be applied onto the surface before the color was sprayed.</p>
<p>The copper layer of the PCB was also routed using delicate silver-plated cables in a point-to-point manner. (Thanks to <a href="http://www.headphoneamp.co.kr/index.php?mid=diy_sijosae&page=15&document_srl=17025">Sijosae</a> schematics and point-to-point hints)</p>
<p>Although the amp was later replaced by the PCB-based version, this first amp is still carefully preserved until today.</p>

<p>(2012) DIY 6N3-6080 Class A Tube Headphone Amplifier</p>
<p>Interested in making headphone amplifiers, this 6N3-6080 amp is the second beginner kit I have purchased and built when I first entered the world of electronics.</p>
<p>Although at that time I have little background on tube amp, the project was overall fun.</p>
<p>With the pre-drilled case and PCBs, the tube amp was completed at one night and the result was astonishing.</p>
<p>The thrill of completing this audio project allured me to go further into the world of audio electronics.</p>

<a id="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who am I?</h3>

<p>I am Bob Chong, an undergraduate student in the Electronics and Information Engineering degree in Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Interested in Electronics and feeling comfortable working in the audio aspects of the discipline, I started building RCA cables and amplifiers since I was in high school. (Feb., 2011) </p>
<p>My recent projects include SA9027 modulized USB DAC (modulized design is inspired by <a href="http://www.pavouk.org/hw/audiosystem20/en_pcm5102dac.html">pavork.org</a>) and discrete operational amplifier for audio purposes. (Reference: <a href="http://innocent-key.com/wordpress/?page_id=2164">Innocent Key</a>)</p>

<h3>What makes me start DIY?</h3>

<p>Back then I was going to purchase a headphone amplifier to drive my Audio-Technica A900 closed-back headphones. I attempted to purchase one and had the plan suspended since I found that a decent quality amp would be priced for at least HKD$2000 at that time. </p>
<p>Knowing that building one may have much more fun than straight up buying one, I started to learn basic electronics and soldering with notes provided by my physics teacher in high school. This is how I started the DIY projects back in 2010 and 2011. </p>
<p>It would be a pleasure for me to purchase different kinds of amateur electronics kits and assembling them in the weekend. Despite having few creative elements involved, I had built up passion towards analog electronics and electroacoustics through soldering the components and grasp the basic knowledge before I attended the higher diploma courses in electronics engineering. </p>
<p>In last year, I succeeded in my 2nd trial to build my first USB DAC using PCM2706 and the antique yet good-sounding TDA1543. This is when I have started to expand my interest beyond analog electronics. </p>
