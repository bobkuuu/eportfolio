Interested in Electronics and feeling comfortable working in the audio aspects of the discipline, I started building RCA cables and amplifiers since I was in high school. Back then I was going to purchase a headphone amplifier to drive my Audio-Technica A900 closed-back headphones. I attempted to purchase 1 and had the plan suspended since I found that a decent quality amp would be priced for at least HKD$2000 at that time. Knowing that building one may have much more fun than straight up buying 1, I started to learn basic electronics and soldering with notes provided by my physics teacher in high school. This is how I started the DIY projects back in 2010 and 2011. It would be a pleasure for me to purchase different kinds of amateur electronics kits and assembling them in the weekend. Despite having few creative elements involved, I had built up passion towards analog electronics and electroacoustics through soldering the components and grasp the basic knowledge before I attended the higher diploma courses in electronics engineering. In last year, I succeeded in my 2nd trial to build my first USB DAC using PCM2706 and the antique yet good-sounding TDA1543. This is when I have started to expand my interest beyond analog electronics. My recent projects include SA9027 modulized USB DAC and discrete operational amplifier for audio purposes.",
